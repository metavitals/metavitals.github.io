__VISTA Adaptive Maintenance__ (VAM) provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for maintaining continuity of the Veterans Information Systems Technology Architecture ([VISTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) and the VA workflows it supports using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices during the multi-year EHR modernization ([EHRM](https://www.fedscoop.com/va-cio-expect-another-10-years-vista-facilities-new-ehr-rollout/)) program. VAM will be deployed within the VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Amazon CloudWatch.  __VA's Cloud-First, Cloud-Native strategy and roadmap__ including policies, documents, and architecture are [here](/va-cloud). 


__Strategic Benefits__:
  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 100+ distinct, decentralized VISTA systems during multi-year VA modernization transition.
  * Move from disparate VA data centers to single Federally-certified commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care
  * Safely and incrementally centralize VISTA functionality in the Cloud, with *no loss of VA- or veteran-specific care or services*
  * Centralized, cloud-based, off the shelf monitoring and security of VISTA client activity
  * Current VISTA clients and workflows fully supported and secured
